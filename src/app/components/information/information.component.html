<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>
	In order to get started, you have to set up a couple of things. First off we are set the API key for osu!. This can
	be done This can be done <a [routerLink]="['/settings']">here</a>, or by clicking on cogwheels (<fa-icon
		[icon]="['fas', 'cogs']"></fa-icon>) on the left. <br />
	After you have set your API key, we are gonna set up the IRC connection. This is so that the results will be posted
	to the multiplayer lobby. This can be done <a [routerLink]="['/login']">here</a>, or by clicking on <fa-icon
		[icon]="['fas', 'sign-in-alt']"></fa-icon> on the left. <br /><br />
	After these two steps, you are pretty much ready to go. Go to "Create a lobby" in the left sidebar to create a lobby
	and "Lobby overview" to view all the created lobbies.
